# SyntheticBiology


## Overview

This repository hosts the Jupyter notebook developed for the Synthetic Biology project. The aim of this project is to design a genetic AND-gate circuit for the controlled *in situ* production of IL-1Ra (UniProt accession: P18510) to mitigate Elevydis-derived muscle inflammation issues. Elevydis (https://www.elevidys.com/) is the first FDA-approved gene therapy for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It delivers a gene encoding for a shortened, partially-functional version of the wild type dystrophin protein (UniProt accession: P11532). However, it still has serious unsolved issues, such as immune responses against AAV vectors, skeletal and cardiac muscle inflammation, and liver toxicity. This repository is created to share the Python code used for developing and testing our circuit's mathematical model.
